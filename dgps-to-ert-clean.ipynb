    "# Importing dGPS points and preparing an ERT mesh for CRTomo\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a .zip file out of our dGPS system (via SW Maps, https://aviyaantech.com/swmaps/). This file contains .geojson files with data points for each exported layer, as well as geo-tagged photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This here is an attempt to provide a Jupyter-Lab-based GUI workflow for importing, selecting and processing measured locations and finally create a Finite-Element mesh usable by CRMod/CRTomo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently three steps are implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1) Read a .geojson file directly from a .zip file generated by SW-Maps. This is done using the `geojson_from_zip_selector` object\n",
    " * Example: Download and the upload this example file:\n",
    "    https://github.com/geophysics-ubonn/binder_dgps_to_ert/raw/master/ert1%20GeoJSON.zip\n",
    "* 2) Arange and ignore electrodes. This is done using the `electrode_manager`\n",
    "  * Example: \"Do not use\" electrode 7, as this is a duplicate\n",
    "* 3) Generate a CRMod/CRTomo mesh. This is done using the `crtomo_mesh` object\n",
    "  * Example: For faster meshing, set the characteristic length to 0.3"
